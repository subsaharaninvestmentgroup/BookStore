How to Use Your Bookstore Dashboard

Welcome to your bookstore's control panel! This guide will walk you through how to manage your online store using the simple tools available in your dashboard.

## 1. Getting Started: The Dashboard Overview

When you first log in, you'll land on the **Dashboard**. This is your command center, giving you a quick look at your store's performance. You can see:
- Total Revenue
- Total Sales
- Number of Customers
- Your Best-Selling Book
- A chart of your sales over time
- Your most recent orders

Use the menu on the left side of the screen to navigate to different sections.

## 2. How to Manage Orders

Go to the **Orders** section from the side menu to see a list of all customer orders.

- **View Order Details**: Click on any order in the list to see more details, like what the customer bought and their shipping address.
- **Update Shipping Status**: Find the order you want to update. Click on its current status (e.g., "Processing") to open a dropdown menu. You can then change the status to "Shipped," "Delivered," or "Cancelled."
- **Add a Tracking Link**: If you select "Shipped" for a physical book, a box will appear asking for a tracking URL. Paste the tracking link from your shipping provider here. This will automatically send an email to the customer with the tracking link so they can follow their package.

## 3. How to Manage Your Books

Go to the **Books** section to manage your book inventory.

- **Add a New Book**: Click the "Add Book" button. Fill out the form with the book's title, author, price, description, and other details. You can also upload a book cover image and any extra files (like workbooks or audio guides).
- **Edit an Existing Book**: Find the book you want to edit in the list. Click the three-dots icon on the right and select "Edit."
- **Delete a Book**: Click the three-dots icon and select "Delete."
- **Share a Book Link**: To get a direct link to a book's page in your store, click the three-dots icon next to the book and select "Share." The link will be copied to your clipboard, so you can paste it anywhere you like (e.g., in an email or a social media post).

## 4. How to Manage Customers

Go to the **Customers** section to see a list of everyone who has created an account or made a purchase.

- **View Customer Details**: Click on any customer to see their contact information, how many orders they've made, and how much they've spent in total.

## 5. How to Create Promotional Banners

Go to the **Banners** section to create beautiful banners for your store's homepage.

- **Add a New Banner**: Click the "Add Banner" button.
- **Fill in the Details**: Give your banner a title and a description.
- **Link to a Book**: You can link the banner directly to one of your books. When a customer clicks the banner, they'll be taken straight to that book's page.
- **Generate with AI**: If you've linked a book, you can click the "Generate with AI" button, and the system will automatically write a catchy title and description for you!
- **Activate the Banner**: Make sure the "Set banner as active" switch is turned on for it to appear on your storefront.

## 6. How to Change Your Store Settings

Go to the **Settings** section to adjust your store's preferences.

- **Change Currency**: You can change the currency displayed in your store (e.g., from USD to ZAR).
- **Set Company Email**: You can enter a company email address here. This is the email that will receive a copy of every order confirmation, so you always have a record.
